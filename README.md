# PWM Library for Arduino

This is a simple library for generating Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals on a specified pin. You can set the frequency and duty cycle of the PWM signal, and the library handles the timing and state transitions to produce the correct high and low pulses.

## Features
- Generate PWM signals with configurable frequency and duty cycle.
- Efficiently manage signal generation with a simple interface.
- Non-blocking: The `loop()` function should be called continuously in the main loop to keep the PWM signal running.

## Installation

## Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the `PWM` library in your Arduino sketch.

```cpp
#include <PWM.h>

PWM pwm(9, 1000, 50); // Pin 9, Frequency: 1000Hz, Duty Cycle: 50%

void setup() {
  // Setup code here
}

void loop() {
  pwm.loop();  // Call the loop() function continuously in the main loop
}
```

## Library Functions

### `PWM::PWM(uint8_t pin, double freq, uint8_t dutyCycle)`
Constructor to initialize the PWM on a specific pin with a given frequency and duty cycle.
- `pin`: The pin number to generate PWM on.
- `freq`: The frequency of the PWM signal in Hz.
- `dutyCycle`: The duty cycle of the PWM signal (0-100).

### `void PWM::loop()`
Generates the PWM signal by toggling the pin between HIGH and LOW based on the calculated high and low times. This function must be called repeatedly inside the main `loop()` to keep the PWM signal active.

### `void PWM::updateTimings()`
Updates the internal high and low times based on the current frequency and duty cycle. This is automatically called during initialization, but can be called manually if you change the frequency or duty cycle.

## How It Works

The PWM signal is generated by alternating between HIGH and LOW states with precise timing. The period of the signal is determined by the specified frequency, and the high time is determined by the duty cycle. The low time is the remainder of the period.

### Timing Calculation
- **Period** = 1 / Frequency (in microseconds)
- **High Time** = Period * Duty Cycle (in microseconds)
- **Low Time** = Period - High Time (in microseconds)

The `loop()` function checks the elapsed time since the last state change and toggles the pin based on the calculated high and low times.
